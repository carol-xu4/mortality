## notes :o
- NBER files refer to the same code book, unclear what was changed from original NVSS data??
- 2021 link does not work 
- Entity axis is raw data on death certificates; record axis is cleaned by NVSS. Kept all "record_1...20" columns

## Columns (CDC/NCHS codebook)
### Demographics:
- "sex"
- "age"
- "monthdth" -> month of death
- "year" -> year of death
- "race"

### Variables:
- "ucod" -> Underlying Cause of Death 
    - X40-44: unintentional / accidental poisoning by and exposure to drugs and other biological substances
    - X60-64: suicide / intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to drugs and other biological susbstances
    - X85: assault / homicide by drugs, biological substances and other and unspecified noxious substances 
    - Y10-14: - undetermined intent, poisoning by and exposure to drugs and biological substances
- "record_1...20" -> specific substances?
